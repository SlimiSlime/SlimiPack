# SlimiPack
PVP Resource Pack for Minecraft 1.8.9

## Upcoming Features:
- Orange to purple gradient bed texture, possibly animated
- Release a sandstone overlay, as the current textures are ugly in some bedwars maps
- Convert all connected textures from ctm_compact, which causes some smooth lighting issues 
- Fix any other issues/bugs
